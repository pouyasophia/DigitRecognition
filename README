This project is a simple multilayer perceptrons (feed forward) neural network made from scratch. This project uses a Matrix class with all the matrix functions for math operations used in the NeuralNetwork class. The primary working class is NeuralNetwork which uses a FeedBack and FeedForward function. The main file calls NeuralNetwork for an epoch to predict the outcome of an XOR gate. All .cpp files are included in the src/ directory, and all .hpp files are located in the inc/ directory.

To build: 
make clean; make

To run the code:
./build/digRec 

To run debug:
